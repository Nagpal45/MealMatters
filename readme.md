# MealMatters 
Hackbytes-II hackathon project

## Inspiration 
Our hackathon project, Meal Matters, was inspired by the pressing issues of food waste and food insecurity. We wanted to create a solution that leverages technology to connect surplus food with those in need, making a meaningful impact on both fronts.

## What it does
Meal Matters is a web-based application that allows individuals to easily donate their excess food from events or everyday life to NGOs. Users can choose the type of NGO they want to support, and our platform facilitates the seamless donation process. This ensures that surplus meals find their way to those who need them the most, reducing food waste and addressing hunger.

## How we built it
To bring Meal Matters to life, we employed a combination of web development technologies. We utilized React.js for the front end. For the backend, we used Node.js and MongoDB database to handle user authentication by jwt, donation matching, and data management using context API.

## What's Next for Meal Matters
We need to work on our UI/UX.
We need to add the functionality of the user dashboard so that they can check the progress of their request and respond to it. We also need to add a dashboard for us where we can manage our tickets as our current method is not so efficient and safe. Also, we need to work on connecting the user and NGO according to their location.
